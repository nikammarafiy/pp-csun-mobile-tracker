Often the goal of a parent or care-taker of a child with special needs is for their child to become more independent. This may manifest as something as trivial to us as walking to class unsupervised. This is not so trivial for the parent or care-taker who is concerned about the well-being of their child.

It is possible that a parent or care-taker would gain some peace of mind if they could remotely monitor the progress of their child on their journey. The child would be equipped with a mobile phone that reports its location to a website monitored by the parent or care-taker. The parent or care-taker could also set alerts based upon destination, time, route, and loitering.
